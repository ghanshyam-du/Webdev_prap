Authentication - the process of verifying who a user is.(it checks whether the person trying to access a system is actually the one they claim to be.)

Authentication patterns:-  
  ** Statefull - which maintains state or data or server side
      how to transfer uid(unique id) - cookies, response, headers.

      work flow
      client ----> auth middleware(checks for cookie value of uid, if valid calls next() else rejects the request) ---> endpoint route
  ** stateless - which has no state
